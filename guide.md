# Guide to Adding Docs

## Overview

This document provides step by step guidance for creating docs in this repository for the QAT standards.

## Required Software

You will need to have the following installed to work with the docs effectively, all are available on service now):

- github desktop
- nodejs
- vscode

Ideally you would also have docker installed but with software restrictions as they are currently at UKHSA this isn't possible on normal laptops.

### Optional Software

You do not need but can also install:

- git (it's called `GIT (x64)` on service now)

## Required Access

You will need access to the `ukhsa-collaboration` org and you will need to be added to the [`qat-standards-contributors`][1] team.
This should give you access to the `standards-qat` repository (i.e. the repository this file is in).

## Get the code

To access the code you can use github desktop (you can also use the `git` command line program if you have it installed, see optional software above).

To clone the repository with github desktop you can follow the github guide to [authenticate][2] and then [clone][3] the repository.

This should mean you now have the repository on your laptop.

## Working With the Documentation

All documentation and related assets must be placed in the `docs/` directory.
