# QAT Engagement Process
The Quality Assurance and Testing Team (QAT) will need to be actively engaged on entering the Beta planning phase and prior to any TACB submission.

Optionally in earlier phases such as Alpha we can assist with advice, guidance and/or early test delivery.

## How to contact us

Programs can submit requests for QAT services, including [Request Test Assurance Support] or [Request Test Delivery Support] through the Jira Service Desk portal. 

Upon submission, the QAT team will reach out to guide you through the next steps.

Contact Lee Woodcock (Lee.Woodcock@ukhsa.gov.uk) or Tigin Joseph (Tigin.Joseph@ukhsa.gov.uk) for assistance on completing a request or general queries.

## Test Delivery
Test Delivery requests are also dealt with by the QAT Initiative Lead (Lee.Woodcock@ukhsa.gov.uk) where scope, options and involvement can be discussed. 

QAT can deliver one or more of the following:

- Test Management
- Functional Test Delivery (e.g. System Testing, System Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing)
- Test Automation
- Accessibility Testing 
- Performance Testing
- Operational Acceptance Testing

## Statement of Work Process (SOW) - Test Delivery Work Only
Test Delivery Work is cross charged via a SOW. The final draft of this process is in final review and will be published here shortly.

If you are not yet sure on detail and require a higher level Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), this can also be provided.

For questions on the SOW Process please contact Kelvin Noble (Kelvin.Noble@ukhsa.gov.uk).
