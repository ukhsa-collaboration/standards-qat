# UKHSA Risk Assessment Framework
UKHSA Risk Assessment framework ensures that all changes are carefully evaluated against established criteria, covering both functional and non-functional risks. This process involves defining clear acceptance criteria, documenting risk levels for each change, and assigning appropriate tests to high- and medium-risk areas.

The comprehensive approach helps mitigate potential delivery risks, ensuring that all tests are linked to relevant change tickets and traceable through the risk tracking system. This method aims to provide full visibility into the testing process, enhancing project reliability and success.

Test managers/ Test leads are responsible for identifying and tracking QAT-related risks, ensuring these risks are properly documented in the program's risk register
